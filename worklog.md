# Work Log

### 8th October 2022
Last time:
I produced a backend I can use for this application on a previous project. I now want to produce a front end with React for this habit tracker.

Goals:
Get the structure of the project setup and learn to use the React Modals. Move on to login / register functionality.

Blockers:
Just starting out on this new project.

### 9th October 2022
Last time:
I setup the React app and looked at bringing up the modals and login functionality. 

Goals:
Get list of users habits to render on page load after login. Set up the habit list page with the different buttons and titles.

Blockers:
Lots of different props to pass through from list of habits component to individual habits to their modals. I have looked at what data would be needed where and where it needs to come from more closely so I can structure it all correctly.

### 10th October 2022
Last time:
I got the list of habits with the relevant buttons to render on pageload and can open modals with the relevant data.

Goals:
Now that the data from the backend can be seen I need to enable requests to change the data. The goal for today is to allow create new habits button to work, enable the current value of times habit has been completed to be incremented and decremented, and allow habits to be deleted.

Blockers:
I learnt to use popovers quickly so that I could have a nice confirm delete option when you go to delete a habit.

### 11th October 2022
Last time:
Completed the required CRUD functionality for the habits.

Goals:
Finish register modal, finish more tests, and do styling.

Blockers:
I needed to look at mocking axios for tests but found what I needed on stack overflow to do this.

### 12th October 2022
Last time:
I finished off the last features of the app, the tests and the styling.

Goals:
Finish the README, deploy the site to netlify and heroku, and submit the challenge.

Blockers:
